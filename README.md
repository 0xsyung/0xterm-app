# 0xterm

`0xterm` is a retro-styled, web-based terminal interface designed for interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and EVM-compatible smart contracts. It bridges the gap between classic command-line user experiences and modern Web3 tooling.

---

## **Features**

* **Interactive CLI Shell:** Type commands or use integrated widgets inside a terminal environment complete with Matrix rain effects and logs.
* **DeFi Operations:**
  * Swap tokens.
  * Add liquidity and manage pools.
  * Initialize new liquidity pools[cite: 1].
  * Check account and token balances[cite: 1].
* **Foundry Smart Contract Backend:** Complete development environment for testing, deploying, and managing core contracts (Tokens, Routers, WETH)[cite: 1].
* **Wagmi-Powered Web3 Integration:** Robust support for connecting EVM wallets and switching networks seamlessly[cite: 1].

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**
* Node.js (v18+ recommended)[cite: 1]
* npm or yarn[cite: 1]
* [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) (for smart contract compilation and testing)[cite: 1]

### **2. Frontend Installation & Running**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### **3. Smart Contracts (Foundry)**
The smart contracts live in the separate [0xterm-contracts](https://github.com/0xsyung/0xterm-contracts) repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com-bob:0xsyung/0xterm-contracts.git
cd 0xterm-contracts
forge test
```

## **Environment**

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HL_BUILDER_ADDRESS` | 0xterm Hyperliquid **builder** address that receives fee share on routed PERPS fills (#190). Must be a funded (≥100 USDC) standard-AA perps account. Until set, the app uses the zero-address placeholder and builder approval / order routing will fail on-chain. Testnet-first (API `api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz`, HyperEVM 998). |
